# Nbyula-Assignment-
What are our expectations?
Part 1: Test planning
We would like you to make a small document describing the test planning for the test activities
for an Nbyula. This project is a new marketplace website which just started development. Until
now testing has not been performed in this project. The PO/PM asked you to make a small
document in which the test activities are defined for the upcoming six months until delivery.
Consider it as a mini-test plan with a timeline.
Part 2: Test automation
We are expecting you to demonstrate your knowledge of test automation by sending in a fully
running assignment. We expect you to have a generated report after running. Depending on
your experience we also expect a framework to be set up and also a basic pipeline set up or
thought about (for example maybe add a yml file). The tool you choose can be any of the tools
you are aware of currently being used in the industry.
What do I need to automate, you might ask, we will leave that up to you. Make a choice of some
interesting flows using the following website.
1. https://nbl.one - we have created a sandboxed environment of the production website,
please only use this website for running your tests.
Some challenging scenarios to automate if you need to start somewhere:
● Access https://nbl.one, validate if there is at least 1 quest.
● Access https://nby.la/rdJuXp and try booking the skylift
● Access https://nbl.one/listings, then scrape all the cards for title, price and link
associated to each card.
● Any other interesting flow you find in the website
